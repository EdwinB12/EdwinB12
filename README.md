Hi Everyone! I'm Edwin Brown. 

I am a Machine Learning Engineer currently working at the University of Sheffield as part of the Research Software Engineer (RSE) team! 

Although I am a geophysicist by training, I have been focused on data science and machine learning for the last 3 years. 

I help implement machine learning solutions to a wide variety of research applications.
